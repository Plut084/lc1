# because the binding constraint on a desktop is RAM, not cores -- 32 concurrent C++

# Two things in the invocation are load-bearing: shaders/shader.spv is opened relative
# to the working directory, so it cd's into the build tree first, and the Linux side
# sources the conan run env, which is what puts the conan validation layer on
# VK_LAYER_PATH -- startup fails without it, with a "layer not found" error that looks
# like the layer is missing when it is not.
#
# The Windows side has the mirror-image problem: profiles/mingw64 deliberately does not
# build the layers (see conanfile.py), and a plain wine prefix has none either, so a
# Debug exe gets as far as instance creation and stops. LC1_NO_VALIDATION=1 is the
# switch main.cpp already has for exactly this, and it is left to the caller to set:
# silently disabling the safety net on every wine run is how it stops being one.
