# The system loader is dlopened exactly once, by lc1::VulkanLoader
# (vk::raii::Context's no-argument constructor: libvulkan.so on Linux,
# vulkan-1.dll on Windows), which hands its vkGetInstanceProcAddr to GLFW via
# glfwInitVulkanLoader so that GLFW never loads one itself. A conan
# vulkan-loader could only be a *second* loader: Context{} dlopens by name no
# matter what is linked, and VK_NO_PROTOTYPES leaves nothing that would call
# into the linked copy. This holds on both platforms -- it is not a Linux
# workaround.
#
# This was volk's job until 2026-09-21. volk is no longer a dependency: after
# the vk::raii migration nothing called a bare vk* function, so volk's
# per-level function-pointer tables were never read, and its only remaining
# work was one dlopen plus one vkGetInstanceProcAddr lookup -- which
# vk::raii::Context already does. See the note at the top of include/lc1/vk/common.hpp.
